What We Need?
=============

Required Components
-----------------------


**Raspberry Pi**

The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore
computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and
Python.

Our kit applies to the following versions of the product of Raspberry Pi:

.. note:: This kit currently does not fully support Raspberry Pi 5, and some examples may not be available.


**Power Adapter**

To connect to a power socket, the Raspberry Pi has a micro USB port (the
same found on many mobile phones). You will need a power supply which
provides at least 2.5 amps.

**Micro SD Card**

Your Raspberry Pi needs an SD card to store all its files and the
Raspberry Pi OS. You will need a micro SD card with a capacity of at
least 8 GB.

Optional Components
-------------------------

**Screen**

To view the desktop environment of Raspberry Pi, you need to use the
screen that can be a TV screen or a computer monitor. If the screen has
built-in speakers, the Pi plays sounds via them.

**Mouse & Keyboard**

When you use a screen , a USB keyboard and a USB mouse are also needed.

**HDMI**

The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI output port that is compatible with the HDMI
ports of most modern TV and computer monitors. If your screen has only
DVI or VGA ports, you will need to use the appropriate conversion line.

**Case**

You can put the Raspberry Pi in a case; by this means, you can protect
your device.

**Sound or Earphone**

The Raspberry Pi is equipped with an audio port about 3.5 mm that can be
used when your screen has no built-in speakers or when there is no
screen operation.
